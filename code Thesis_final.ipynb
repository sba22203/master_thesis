        "Autocorrelation Function (ACF): The ACF values decline as the lag between data points increases. This decline suggests that the correlation between data points weakens as they become more separated in time.\n",
        "The ACF value at lag 0 is always 1.0 because it represents the correlation of the time series with itself at the same time point.\n",
        "The ACF values decrease gradually but do not reach zero quickly, indicating some level of correlation between nearby data points.\n",

        "\n",
        "PACF values exhibit a more intricate pattern compared to ACF. Several PACF values significantly differ from zero.\n",
        "The PACF value at lag 1 is notably high, indicating a strong correlation between the current data point and the one immediately preceding it.\n",
        "There are discernible spikes in the PACF plot at specific lags, suggesting direct correlations with those lags.\n",

        "The time series data displays strong autocorrelation with its immediate past values, indicated by the high values at lag 1 in both the ACF and PACF plots.\n",
        "The gradual decline in ACF values and the presence of significant PACF spikes hint at the possibility of an autoregressive (AR) component in the data. In AR models, the current value is influenced by its past values."

        "\n",
        "Performance Metrics:\n",
        "Let's examine the updated performance metrics:\n",
        "\n",
        "MAE (Mean Absolute Error): The MAE is approximately 227.86, indicating that, on average, the model's predictions deviate from the actual values by about 227.86 points. Lower MAE values are desirable, but it's essential to consider the scale of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "MSE (Mean Squared Error): The MSE stands at 62,881.45, reflecting the average squared difference between the model's predictions and the actual values.\n",
        "\n",
        "RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): With an RMSE of 250.76, this metric represents the square root of the MSE. It provides insight into the average magnitude of errors, measured in the same units as the target variable. Lower RMSE values are indicative of improved model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error): The MAPE has been calculated at 17.38%, indicating that, on average, the model's predictions exhibit an absolute percentage error of 17.38%. Lower MAPE values correspond to higher prediction accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "R-squared (R2): The R-squared value is negative (-2.65), meaning that our model does not fit the data well. this measure indicates that the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables. A negative value suggests that the model's predictions are less accurate than simply using the mean of the target variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall Assessment:\n",
        "While the Bayesian optimization process has refined the hyperparameters for the Prophet model, the updated performance metrics still suggest suboptimal model performance. The negative R-squared value indicates that the model may struggle to capture the underlying patterns within the dataset. To enhance forecasting accuracy, it remains crucial to investigate other factors such as data quality, feature engineering, and potentially explore alternative modeling approaches. Further analysis is warranted to gain insights into the reasons behind the model's limited fit and to identify opportunities for improvement."

        "Mean Squared Error (MSE):\n",
        "\n",
        "The MSE value of approximately 62104.87 represents the average squared difference between the model's predictions and the actual values. A higher MSE suggests a significant spread in prediction errors, potentially due to outliers or model inaccuracies.\n",
        "Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):\n",
        "\n",
        "The RMSE value of approximately 249.21 is the square root of the MSE and provides a sense of the average magnitude of prediction errors. It is similar to the MAE but gives more weight to larger errors. In this case, the RMSE is smaller than the MAE, indicating that larger errors have less impact on the overall RMSE.\n",

        "\n",
        "The MAPE value is expressed as a percentage and is useful for understanding the relative magnitude of errors.\n",

        "The R-squared (R2) value of approximately -2.60 is unexpectedly negative. R-squared measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. A negative R2 suggests that the model is performing worse than a horizontal line (a model that predicts the mean of the dependent variable). This may indicate that the model is not capturing the underlying patterns in the data effectively.\n",
        "Conclusion:\n",
        "\n",
        "The model's performance, as indicated by the provided metrics, appears to be suboptimal. The MAE, MSE, and RMSE values, although providing insight into the magnitude of errors, suggest that the model's predictions exhibit significant discrepancies from the actual values.\n",
        "The negative R-squared value is a concerning sign, indicating that the model is not explaining the variance in the data and is potentially a poor fit.\n",
        "The MAPE of approximately 17.11% indicates that, on average, the model's percentage errors are moderate.\n",
        "Overall, there may be room for improvement in the model's accuracy and explanatory power. Further model refinement, feature engineering, or parameter tuning may be necessary to enhance its forecasting performance."

        "\n",
        "Initial Variability (August 2020): In August 2020, the indices exhibit variability in their Close prices. Indices such as BEL20 and FTSE100 show relative stability, while others like DAX40 and PSI20 experience fluctuations.\n",

        "Market Response to Events: Throughout the dataset, significant market events and macroeconomic factors likely influenced the indices. Notable price movements may correspond to economic announcements, geopolitical events, or sector-specific news.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pandemic Impact (Early 2020): A visible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic can be seen in early 2020, with a substantial drop in indices' Close prices followed by gradual recoveries.\n",

        "Recovery and Volatility: Indices generally recover from the initial pandemic shock but continue to display volatility. Notably, DAX40 and PSI20 show relatively larger fluctuations compared to others.\n",

        "Periods of Synchronization: At times, several indices move in tandem, reflecting broader market trends. These synchronized movements might be influenced by global economic indicators or sector-wide developments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Differences in Behavior: Despite overall similarities, individual indices exhibit unique behaviors. For instance, FTSE100 and CAC40 show relatively smoother trends, while BEL20 and PSI20 experience more pronounced oscillations."

        "Key Takeaways for Prophet:\n",
        "\n",
        "Recall: The Prophet model achieves a perfect recall score of 1.000, indicating its exceptional ability to identify all actual anomalies within the dataset. This suggests that Prophet excels at capturing true positive cases without missing any, making it highly reliable for anomaly detection tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Precision: The precision of the Prophet model is moderate at 0.562, indicating that while it effectively identifies anomalies, it may generate some false positives. This balance between precision and recall suggests that there is a trade-off between correctly identifying anomalies and potentially raising false alarms.\n",
        "\n",
        "F1-Score: The F1-Score, which balances precision and recall, is also moderate at 0.719. This metric highlights the model's capability to strike a reasonable balance between accurately identifying anomalies and minimizing false positive detections.\n",
        "\n",
        "AUC-ROC: The AUC-ROC score for Prophet is 0.500, which is relatively low. This indicates that the model's Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve performs no better than random chance when distinguishing between anomalies and normal cases. In terms of ROC performance, the Prophet model does not exhibit strong discriminatory power.\n",
        "\n",
        "AUC-PR: The AUC-PR is moderate at 0.781, taking into account the precision-recall trade-off. This value suggests that Prophet provides a reasonable balance between precision and recall in anomaly detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "Comparison to Other Models:\n",
        "\n",
        "Isolation Forest: Isolation Forest demonstrates a very high precision (1.000) and a slightly lower recall (0.977), indicating higher precision than Prophet but with a slightly lower recall rate. However, the lack of an AUC-ROC value makes it challenging to assess its ROC performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "One-Class SVM: One-Class SVM also achieves perfect precision (1.000) but a lower recall (0.562) compared to Prophet. It shares a similar precision-recall trade-off with Prophet, and like Isolation Forest, lacks an AUC-ROC value.\n",
        "\n",
        "NeuralProphet: NeuralProphet achieves perfect precision, recall, and F1-Score, indicating excellence in both precision and recall aspects. However, the absence of an AUC-ROC value makes it difficult to compare in terms of ROC performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "LSTM: LSTM demonstrates a moderate precision (0.555) and perfect recall (1.000), similar to Prophet. It has a slightly lower F1-Score (0.714) than Prophet. Like Prophet, it exhibits a low AUC-ROC (0.500) and a moderate AUC-PR (0.778).\n",
        "\n",
        "Summary: The Prophet model excels in recall, ensuring that it accurately identifies all actual anomalies, making it suitable for tasks where missing any anomalies is critical. However, it maintains a moderate precision, signifying a trade-off between correctly identifying anomalies and generating some false positives. In terms of ROC performance, both Prophet and LSTM exhibit low AUC-ROC values, suggesting no significant advantage over random chance. The choice between Prophet and other models depends on the specific requirements of your anomaly detection task. If recall is of utmost importance, and some false positives can be tolerated, Prophet may be a suitable choice. Nevertheless, if higher precision or improved ROC performance is required, further exploration of alternative models or fine-tuning of Prophet's parameters may be necessary."
